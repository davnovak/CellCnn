# CellCnn

NOTE: This has been adapted by [David Novak](https://github.com/davnovak) to be easily installable in a conda environment with Python 3.8.
Work in progress.

```
conda create -n CellCnn python=3.8
conda activate CellCnn
git clone https://www.github.com/davnovak/CellCnn
cd CellCnn
pip install .
pip install flowio seaborn statsmodels matplotlib
```

This version of `CellCnn` exports `CellCnn`, `train_model`, `discriminative_filters` and `plot_filters`.
